Files Written by Me:
--------------------
ParkInterface.java --- the interface that Park would implement, including
all the methods Park.java overrides

Park.java --- the class of Park object implementing ParkInterface. It stores
all information about Park and includes getter and setter methods.

ParkDataReader.java --- contains two methods to read in the two csv data
files. The first method reads in the csv containing park information and
instantiates park objects. The second method reads in the csv containing
graph information (adjacency matrix) and creates a graph accordingly. 

DataWranglerTests.java --- tests the functionality of ParkDataReader.java and
Park.java to make sure input files are correctly read in and all constructors
and methods return correct outputs.
